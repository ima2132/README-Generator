## Description 

Having a well-crafted GitHub profile plays a significant role in establishing your professional career as a developer. GitHub is often the first place that prospective employers look to evaluate your capabilities and level of professionalism. In today's digital age of networking, it is essential to showcase your projects and actively engage with fellow developers, as it can lead to innovative opportunities and collaborations.


This program utilizes the `Inquirer` package to generate a well-structured and professional README file. With this application, you can easily include sections such as usage instructions, installation guidelines, issue reporting guidelines, and contribution guidelines in your README file.

## Installation 
To install the program, you will need to have `VS Code` and `Node.js` installed. First, clone my repo. You will then need to install dependencies in order to use the README Generator. 

To generate the README, run the following command in your terminal:

`npm init -y`

along with 

`npm install`


## Usage

To create your own README file, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone my repo.
2. Install the necessary npm package dependencies by running the command `npm install`, which will install the packages specified in the `package.json` file.
3. Invoke the application by running the command `node index.js`.
4. Answer the questions prompted in the command line to create a markdown file for your README.
